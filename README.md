# About

The good old crossword game made simple with html, css, and (pure) javascript!

Open `index.html` inside the example folder to see the sample, or open the src folder to create your own version. You just need to customize some css grid property and type in your crossword into the javascript. I put the full instruction there.

Note that this crossword only produce the board without showing the clues and numbers (because that's all I need). This crossword is made using just html, css, and javascript, so adding clues and numbers is possible if you want to.

## What this crossword can do:

- Automatically move focus to the next (or previous) input when typing and deleting (by backspace button or delete).
- Change the typing flow of an 'intersectional' input from cross to down by clicking the input twice, and back to cross by clicking it again.
- Navigate through inputs using arrow keys.
- Doing action when all the inputs have filled, and check whether the inputs are correct or not.
